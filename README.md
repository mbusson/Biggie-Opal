# SassyPug

SassyPug is a Javascript application boilerplate derived from [Baptiste Briel](https://github.com/baptistebriel/)'s [biggie](https://github.com/baptistebriel/biggie), which is itself based on [bigwheel](https://github.com/bigwheel-framework), a minimalist framework from [Jam3](http://www.jam3.com/). SassyPug is basically biggie with a few variations in features as you can read in the next section. That plus a cool name based on the latter. Clever, innit? (...)
